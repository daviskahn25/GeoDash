# GeoDash

This was my first attempt to make Geometry Dash. I tried to copy the colors with the classic first level. Next steps going forward would be to
have the charecter jump onto ledges and then fall back off. Another next step could be using multiple photos to show rotation on the jumps just
like in the real game. Overall, I thought this was challenging but fun to make the first steps of.
